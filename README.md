# SlicerProstate

## Introduction

SlicerProstate is an extension of 3D Slicer software (http://slicer.org) that provides a collection of modules to facilitate
* processing and management of prostate image data
* utilizing prostate images in image-guided interventions
* development of the imaging biomarkers of the prostate cancer

While the main motivation for developing the functionality contained in this extension was prostate cancer imaging applications, they can also be applied in different contexts.

See documentation at
http://wiki.slicer.org/slicerWiki/index.php/Documentation/Nightly/Extensions/SlicerProstate.

## Functionality

Current modules include:
* [Distance Map Based Registration](http://wiki.slicer.org/slicerWiki/index.php/Documentation/Nightly/Modules/DistanceMapBasedRegistration): segmentation-based registration approach that can be used to support fusion of MRI-TRUS images
* [Segmentation
  Smoothing](http://wiki.slicer.org/slicerWiki/index.php/Documentation/Nightly/Modules/SegmentationSmoothing):
  utility to smooth segmentations done on thick-slice images
* [Quad Edge Surface
  Mesher](http://wiki.slicer.org/slicerWiki/index.php/Documentation/Nightly/Modules/QuadEdgeSurfaceMesher):
  utility to decimate and smooth triangular surface meshes

This extension is work in progress, and we are planning to add other modules relevant to prostate cancer imaging research .... stay tuned.
